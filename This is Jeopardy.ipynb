Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you'll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and/or other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve."

Filter the dataset for topics that you're interested in, compute the average difficulty of those questions, and train to become the next Jeopardy champion! To explore the rich Jeopardy question dataset and uncover patterns in language, category distribution, and gameplay structure over time. I also aimed to build a simple interactive quiz system using Python to engage with the data dynamically."
